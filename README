README for RDF::Simple distribution

This package is for very simple manipulations of RDF/XML.

It consists of:

RDF::Simple::Parser
RDF::Simple::Serialiser
    
The parser requires XML::SAX and likes to have XML::SAX::Expat.

The aim here is to keep things Simple.
The parser does not differentiate between literal and resource values in the model.
All you get back is a bucket-o-triples (array of arrays).
The serialiser does its best to do DWYM.

If you get error messages like "Unable to provide required features",
that means XML::SAX and/or XML::SAX::Expat is/are not installed properly.
Use CPAN or CPANPLUS to install XML::SAX and XML::SAX::Expat;
or on a Unix system,
you can try to do something like this (adjust for your perl version / location):

ln -s /usr/lib/perl/XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini /usr/local/lib/perl/site/5.10.0/XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini
